A Comparative Study of Edge, Fog and Cloud Architectures for Vacuum Circuit Breaker Monitoring: A Federated Learning Perspective


Vacuum Circuit Breakers (VCBs) are critical components of medium- and high-voltage switchgear systems used in modern power distribution networks. They are responsible for interrupting fault currents and ensuring the safe operation of electrical systems by isolating faulty sections. The reliability and performance of VCBs are critical to the overall health and stability of power systems. As these breakers operate under mechanical and electrical stress, it is essential to analyze and predict their operating conditions. Specifically, vibration analysis and coil/motor current monitoring are commonly used techniques that provide early fault detection with high diagnostic value. With increasing digitization and automation of switchgear systems, the ability to monitor VCBs in real-time has become crucial for improving system uptime, operational efficiency and safety.

One of the major challenges that remains unresolved despite advancements in condition monitoring is in determining the optimal computational layer —Edge, Fog or Cloud—for processing the large volumes of data generated by VCB monitoring systems. Each architecture presents its own trade-offs. While Cloud computing offers high processing power and centralized control, it suffers from latency, bandwidth limitations and potential privacy issues. On the other hand, Edge and Fog computing promise faster, decentralized processing closer to the data source, but they may be constrained by limited computational resources and implementation complexity. Furthermore, the integration of AI techniques such as Federated Learning (FL) introduces additional layers of complexity in data handling and model training. Currently, there is a lack of a comprehensive framework that benchmarks these architectures, in particular, for real-time VCB condition monitoring, resulting a significant gap in both research and practical deployment.

To address this gap, the project is guided by the following research questions:

1.	How do Cloud, Fog and Edge architectures compare in terms of latency, bandwidth consumption, AI performance, data privacy, engineering feasibility, and data distribution strategies for VCB condition monitoring?
2.	If Federated Learning proves to be essential, how can FL and Smart Pooling be integrated to improve the performance of decentralized AI models for this application?

The investigation will be based on a representative switchgear configuration. Performance metrics will be evaluated through experimental or simulated data from vibration and coil/motor current monitoring techniques. Optionally, the experimental implementation of the second question can also be pursued.

Overall, the outcome of this project is expected to support engineering decisions in future smart substation deployments, where reliable and efficient data processing is critical.
